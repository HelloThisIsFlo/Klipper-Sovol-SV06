#
#  Mechanical Gantry Calibration
#
#  Requires TMC2209 drivers with UART control, some tuning and perhaps
#  some printed endstops.
#
#  Based on on (depricated) M915 and now alternate G34 from Marlin
#  I beleive Prusa use this, certainly there's older videos advising to just
#  ram the gantry at full current into the the z-max stops.
#
#  It moves the gantry to the top of the travel, drops the current and then
#  does a force move to force the steppers to stall against the physical end
#  stops, transfering the level of the frame to the gantry.
#
#  This is the only way to programatically level a multi-stepper single-driver
#  gantry. It may also help with a dual-driver gantry on a bed-slinger design
#  or where the plane of the bed is less trustworthy than the frame.
#
#  It's particularly risky doing Z_TILT_ADJUST and SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE
#  without a mechanical reference as if one side of the gantry or bed is prone
#  to droop, over time both bed and gantry will skew excessively but still read
#  as level, so this can help transfer "level" from the frame to the gantry and
#  then to the bed.
#
#  I don't recommend doing this in a START_PRINT, I call this if a
#  SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE shows some drift, althoughon an Ender 3 type printer
#  it's prudent to check the v-slot rollers for correct adjustment if drift is
#  observed.
#
#  It's probably best to run this and then do SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE
#  until the bed is really level. IF you have dual Z steppers you can then
#  use Z_TILT_ADJUST for subsequent leveling of the gantry but make sure you
#  use the same points for gantry level as you use in SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE
#
#  It may damage your printer if you do this at too high a current, or don't
#  have proper endstops.
#
#            HERE BE DRAGONS!
#            YOU WERE WARNED!
#
#  Here's a video of this in action
#  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVdIeIIpUAk
#  and the endstops for 2020 v-slot
